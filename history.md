# History Log

- 2024-04-23 01:45: Identified critical visibility issue in non-colors levels. After first screen shatter, center target display and falling targets become invisible, while colors level remains functional. Issue affects alphabet, numbers, shapes, and C/L case modes.
- 2024-04-23 01:30: Updated game element visibility after screen shatter. Fixed center target, falling targets, and HUD text to maintain proper contrast with alternating background colors.
- 2023-10-XX: Updated level background colors. All levels now start with a white background and alternate with a black theme upon shattering. 
- 2023-10-XX: Fixed background shatter mechanic. Screen now requires the full amount of misclicks (MAX_CRACKS) to shatter after the first instance, ensuring consistent behavior. 
- 2023-10-XX: Corrected crack color and shape outline colors to dynamically contrast with the alternating background after shatters.
