Note: Replaced welcome screen implementation. The new version uses dynamic particle effects (starfield) and text rendering. Monitor performance on target device (QBOARD) in case adjustments to particle count or effects are needed to prevent overstimulation or lag.

                           ^^^^^
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'WIDTH' where it is not associated with a value

// Cause: In the "colors" mode branch of game_loop, WIDTH and HEIGHT were redefined as local variables (via screen.get_size()), which shadows the global WIDTH/HEIGHT. This causes UnboundLocalError when other code expects the global WIDTH/HEIGHT to be available.
// Solution: Remove the local assignment of WIDTH, HEIGHT in the "colors" mode, and always use the global WIDTH, HEIGHT for all logic and drawing.
