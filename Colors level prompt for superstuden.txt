Colors level prompt for superstudent:

Level Name: Colors Level

Core Concept: Click the target dots that match the initial "Mother Dot" color amidst a cloud of bouncing distractor dots.

Gameplay Flow & Animation:

    Initiation: The level begins with a large, solid-colored circle (the "Mother Dot") appearing centrally. Its color is randomly chosen from: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, or Black.
    Cue: The Mother Dot briefly vibrates lightly.
    Dispersion: The Mother Dot dissipates, breaking apart into 100 smaller, circular "Dots" that begin bouncing randomly within the play area.
    Dot Composition:
        Target Dots (25%): 25 of the 100 dots will be the same color as the original Mother Dot.
        Distractor Dots (75%): The remaining 75 dots will be composed of the other 5 available colors, distributed equally (15 dots of each non-target color).
    Player Interaction:
        Clicking a Target Dot (matching the Mother Dot) causes it to react (e.g., explode, vanish).
        Clicking a Distractor Dot (any other color) has no effect; the dot continues bouncing unharmed.
    Objective: The player must find and click all 25 Target Dots.
