## 2024-06-22: Enhanced Screen Fracture Animation
- Added delay between screen shattering and game over screen to display fracture animation
- Increased particle count (200 vs 100) for more dramatic glass shattering effect
- Extended particle duration to improve visibility of the shattering effect
- Fixed issue where game over screen was appearing before players could see the glass break

## 2024-06-22: Colors Level Visual Enhancement
- Standardized Colors level background handling to match other game modes
- Added star background effects to Colors level for visual consistency
- Implemented screen shake effects in Colors level
- Applied proper offset handling for shake animations in explosions and dot rendering
- Simplified visualization code by reusing existing background system

## 2024-06-22: Game Over Screen Click Delay
- Added 5-second delay before allowing clicks on the game over screen
- Implemented countdown timer showing seconds remaining before click is enabled
- Prevents accidental or premature dismissal of the game over screen
- Changes instruction text from "Click to continue" to countdown text until delay expires

## 2024-06-11: Modified Shapes Level Behavior
- Added second round of shapes: After the first round of shapes is destroyed, they now rain down a second time
- Changed completion behavior: After all shapes are destroyed (in both rounds), now shows checkpoint screen instead of level select
- Added tracking variable `shapes_first_round_completed` to monitor progress

## 2024-06-11: Bug Fix for Shapes Level Completion
- Fixed issue where checkpoint screen wasn't being displayed after completing both rounds of shapes
- Implemented direct call to checkpoint_screen() function after shapes level completion
- Simplified level completion logic to avoid redundant code paths

## 2024-06-11: Checkpoint Screen Behavior Fix
- Modified shapes level checkpoint screen behavior to match colors level
- "Continue" button now restarts the shapes level instead of returning to menu
- "Menu" button still returns to level select screen

## 2024-06-11: Checkpoint Screen Return Value Fix
- Fixed issue where "Continue" button in shapes level wasn't properly restarting the level
- Moved checkpoint screen logic to the correct location in the code
- Ensured proper return values to trigger level restart when "Continue" is pressed

## 2024-06-09: Colors Level Overhaul
- Changed target notification from text to a massive ghost dot that appears for 2 seconds
- Modified level mechanics to continue until player chooses to exit via checkpoint screen
- Added checkpoint screen trigger every 10 targets destroyed
- Level now respawns a new set of dots when all current targets are destroyed
- Maintained color switching after every 5 targets of the same color destroyed

## 2024-06-09: Colors Level Checkpoint Fix
- Fixed issue where the colors level would use the same color repeatedly after checkpoint
- Added proper color cycling when returning from checkpoint screen
- Ensured global color_idx variable is properly tracked between checkpoints
- The target color now advances to the next in the sequence after each checkpoint

## 2024-06-09: Colors Level Checkpoint Continuation Fix
- Fixed issue where the colors level would completely restart when clicking "Continue" on the checkpoint screen
- Modified checkpoint handling to maintain the current game session instead of returning to the start
- Implemented a mechanism to force dot respawning with the next color in sequence after checkpoint
- Game now properly continues from checkpoint with the next color target without resetting progress

## 2024-06-25: Colors Level Collision Delay Feature
- Added collision delay timer to prevent dots from immediately colliding when created
- Added COLORS_COLLISION_DELAY setting (30 frames) to control the delay duration
- Modified _initialize_bouncing_dots and _generate_new_dots to reset the collision timer
- Updated _update_dots to only check for collisions after the delay expires
- Added visual indicator showing when collisions will be enabled
- Dots can now fully separate before collision detection begins, preventing them from getting stuck together

## 2024-06-25: Adjusted Colors Level Collision Delay
- Increased collision delay from 30 frames to 250 frames (5 seconds at 50 FPS)
- This provides more time for dots to fully separate before collisions are enabled
- Helps prevent dots from getting stuck to each other after generation
- Visual countdown indicator shows when collisions will be enabled

## 2024-06-25: Improved Colors Level Dot Distribution
- Enhanced dot initialization to prevent clustering in the center
- Increased initial dot dispersion radius by 50% for better spreading
- Added larger random position offsets (-50 to +50 pixels vs previous -20 to +20)
- Ensured minimum dot velocity (absolute value sum > 6) to prevent slow-moving dots
- Made dots initially move away from the center to reduce central clustering
- Improved new dot placement algorithm with larger minimum spacing (70px vs 50px)
- Added fallback positioning logic for when standard placement fails, ensuring dots are far from center

## 2024-06-25: Changed Colors Level Collision Behavior
- Completely reworked collision activation to only begin after first color change
- Removed timer-based collision enabling
- Now dots won't collide with each other during initial gameplay
- Added visual indicator explaining that collisions will be enabled after first color change
- This prevents dots from getting stuck in the center during the critical first phase
- After achieving the first color change milestone, collisions become enabled for the remainder of play

## 2024-06-25: Fixed Dots Clustering in Colors Level
- Fixed bug where dots would still get stuck in the center even with collisions disabled
- Added emergency separation mechanism for dots that get too close (distance < 5px)
- Implemented periodic check for center clustering to detect and resolve stuck dots
- Added stronger separation forces and randomized velocities to break up dot clusters
- Fixed capitalization error in collision enabling logic
- Improved dispersion speeds (15-25 vs 12-18) for better initial separation
- Increased velocity minimums (abs sum > 8 vs > 6) for faster dot movement
- Enhanced logging and debugging to better track collision behavior
- Removed erroneous color_changed flag setting in _select_target_color method

## 2024-06-25: Extreme Anti-Clustering Measures for Colors Level
- Completely redesigned dot positioning system to keep dots away from center
- Created a "sector-based" initialization that places dots only in the outer 50% of the screen
- Added "center repulsion field" that actively prevents dots from moving toward center
- Enhanced center detection with larger radius (150px vs 100px) and lower threshold (5 dots vs 10)
- More aggressive center clearing with stronger outward velocities (10-15 vs 5-10)
- Increased check frequency for center clustering (4% chance per frame vs 1%)
- Added emergency boost force for dots that get too close to center
- Ensured initial velocities always point outward from center

## 2024-06-25: Improved Colors Level Dot Dispersion
- Fixed issue where dots would get stuck in the middle after initialization
- Added collision delay mechanism to let dots properly disperse before enabling collisions
- Dots now have 5 seconds to spread out before collision detection activates
- Added visual indicator showing when collisions will be enabled
