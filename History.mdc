- Implemented optimized particle system with object pooling and global particle limits.
- Added particle culling for particles that move too far off-screen to improve performance.
- Modified all particle creation code to use the new optimized system.
- Modified the game to show checkpoint screen for all completed levels, not just colors.
- Set maximum limits for explosions, particles, and swirl particles to prevent lag.
- Reason: These optimizations significantly improve performance on the QBOARD device by preventing excessive particle creation and efficiently managing memory.

**Model: Claude-3.7-Sonnet | Date: 2024-07-13 | Time: 18:20 | Logic:**
